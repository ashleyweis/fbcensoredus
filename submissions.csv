"Troy Blanchard ","Investorsoforlando@gmail.com","During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I felt increasingly silenced simply for asking questions or trying to have honest conversations. I wasn’t spreading conspiracy theories or trying to cause harm—I genuinely wanted to understand what was happening. I had concerns about the vaccine and wanted to explore both the benefits and the risks. I also questioned the effectiveness of mask mandates and lockdowns, not out of defiance, but because something about the narrative felt off to me. But every time I tried to raise these questions online—on platforms where I had previously discussed all kinds of issues freely—I was met with warnings, content removals, and eventually bans.

The first time I was suspended, it was just 24 hours, and I thought maybe it was a mistake. I had shared an article questioning early mask guidance and added my own comment about wanting more data before blindly following everything we were being told. That got flagged. Then came a 48-hour ban when I shared a clip of a medical professional voicing concerns about the speed of vaccine development. After that, longer suspensions followed—up to 10 days in some cases. Each time I returned, I found myself more cautious, even anxious, about what I could say. It felt like I had to self-censor or risk being silenced altogether.

What made it worse was how one-sided everything felt. We were being told to “trust the science,” but science is about questioning, testing, and refining ideas—not just accepting whatever officials say as absolute truth. Yet any attempt to challenge or even discuss alternative viewpoints was met with labels like “misinformation” or “anti-science.” I wasn’t anti-science. I was pro-questioning, pro-critical thinking. It felt like Dr. Fauci and a few other voices were treated as infallible, when in reality, even their guidance changed multiple times. My gut was telling me something wasn’t right, and instead of being allowed to explore that, I was punished.

The censorship didn’t just silence me—it made me feel alienated and deeply distrustful. I didn’t want to be part of some radical movement; I just wanted space for honest dialogue. I wanted to share, to learn, to hear different sides. But the platforms and institutions that once championed open communication shut that down. It taught me a hard truth: during a crisis, even well-intentioned dissent is often unwelcome. And for people like me, who just wanted to think critically and not blindly follow, that was a painful and disheartening realization.","1713 W.
